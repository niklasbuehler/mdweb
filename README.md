mdweb - Markdown Web
===

A dead simple script that creates a static website from some markdown files.  

You can see a page generated by this script at www.niklasbuehler.com.

Simply start writing your markdown files and everything else will be taken care of:
- Custom HTML header and footer depending on the path
- Generation of an RSS feed for your blog posts
- Suckless email-based "comment system", automatically only included for blog posts
- Automatic `rsync` to your server
